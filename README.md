GSP747 Deploy a Hugo Website with Cloud Build and Firebase Pipeline
https://qwiklabs-gcp-00-b8a29bbb047d.web.app/

In this lab you create a pipeline for deploying websites based on Hugo, a static website builder.
You store the website content in a GitHub repository, deploy the website with Firebase, 
then use Cloud Build to create a pipeline to automatically deploy new content that is committed to the repository.
